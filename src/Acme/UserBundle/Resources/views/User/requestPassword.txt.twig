Hi {{ user.firstname }},

Someone (probably you) has requested a new password for your account on 'Conti Tire Management'.

To confirm this and have a new password sent to you via email, go to the following web address:

{{ url }}

In most mail programs, this should appear as a blue link which you can just click on.  If that doesn't work, then cut and paste the address into the address line at the top of your web browser window.


Cheers from the 'Conti Tire Management' administrator
